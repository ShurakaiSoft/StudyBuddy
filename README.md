# Study Buddy

## Overview

This is a simple study aid that tells me what I should study next based on what
I've already studied and a list of what I want to study.

## Proof of concept

The initial proof of concept takes a list of books and randomly chooses a chapter
to read/study.

Future version will track what's studied and eliminate that from the randomization.

# Development

It's a JavaScript/node.js console application.
